# GateFlow

**Replay a dependency graph with explicit approvals and auditable decisions.**

A dependency-free JavaScript engineering workbench by Hamed Minaei.
The browser demo and Node CLI use the **same tested engine source**. No model
API, account, build service or runtime dependency is required.

**[Open live demo](https://hamed665.github.io/approval-workflow-replay/)**

## Try the browser demo

Download the repository and open **[docs/index.html](docs/index.html)** in a modern
browser. It is a self-contained generated file, so it works offline with a
`file://` URL. The example dataset is synthetic. Edit the JSON, run the analysis,
inspect the result table and export the full report. Invalid input clears stale
results and disables export until a new analysis succeeds.

To host the demo, serve `docs/` with any static host. The public demo is also deployed with GitHub Pages.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22 or newer; no `npm install` step is needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamed665/approval-workflow-replay.git
cd approval-workflow-replay
npm test
npm run demo
npm run build
node scripts/demo.mjs examples/input.json
```

## Library interface

```javascript
import { analyze } from './src/core.mjs';
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
const input = JSON.parse(await readFile('examples/input.json', 'utf8'));
const report = analyze(input);
console.log(report.summary, report.rows);
```

See [src/core.mjs](src/core.mjs) for lower-level functions and
[tests/core.test.mjs](tests/core.test.mjs) for behavioral examples.

## What this demonstrates

Every transition has a reason. The implementation is written for inspection: explicit validation,
deterministic behavior, structured reports, realistic failure paths and a
usable responsive demo. All result data is rendered as text, never as HTML.
The UI includes keyboard-operable controls, labeled input, a live error/status
region, an empty state and a horizontally scrollable results table.

## Engineering boundaries

Pure deterministic replay, not an authenticated approval system or task executor. Configured actor/reviewer strings are checked but not identity-verified. No persistence or external side effects. Replay event order is authoritative. Rejected terminal decisions cannot be undone; use a new workflow run.

This is a reference implementation, not a hosted production system. There are
no customer datasets, claimed client deployments or fabricated performance
metrics. Security considerations are documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Architecture

- `src/core.mjs`: domain engine, usable independently of the UI
- `src/validation.mjs`: explicit shared input contracts
- `web/`: accessible presentation and interaction source
- `scripts/build.mjs`: deterministic offline HTML generation
- `scripts/demo.mjs`: JSON-in / JSON-out CLI
- `docs/index.html`: ready-to-open generated browser demo
- `examples/`: synthetic input and captured output
- `tests/`: invariants, boundaries and regression tests

Run `npm run build` after editing engine, UI or input fixtures. CI checks that
the committed demo matches its sources on Node 22 and 24.
